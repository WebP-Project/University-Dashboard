# UniEvent - University Event Management System

UniEvent is a comprehensive, dual-interface frontend application designed to bridge the gap between university event organizers and the student body. It provides administrators with powerful tools to plan events and prevent venue clashes, while offering students a seamless platform to discover and register for campus activities.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Dual-Role Architecture
* **Admin Dashboard:** An interface for university staff to manage the entire event lifecycle.
* **Student Portal:** A clean, user-friendly frontend where students can view and register for upcoming events.

### Administrator Tools
* **Event Pipeline Management:** Distinct workflows for "Event Planning" (drafting) and "Event Confirmation" (finalizing).
* **Intelligent Clash Detection:** Automatically prevents double-booking of venues and time slots by checking against officially confirmed events.
* **Dynamic Confirmation System:** Select from a dynamically generated dropdown of planned events to review details before final confirmation.
* **Real-Time Analytics:** Dashboard metrics track the current number of "Confirmed Events" and "Planning Events."

### Student Experience
* **Live Event Feed:** Students only see events that have passed the "Planning" phase and are officially "Confirmed" by administrators.
* **Seamless Registration:** One-click registration for students to secure their spot at campus events.
